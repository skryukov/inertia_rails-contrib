# InertiaRailsContrib

> Community documentation and generators has been upstreamed to the [Inertia Rails repository](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-rails).
>
> Please visit the official Inertia Rails documentation at https://inertia-rails.dev.

From now on we're planning to use `InertiaRailsContrib` as a playground for new features and ideas.
The gem will be updated with new features and improvements, and then the most successful ones will be proposed to the core Inertia Rails repository.

Future plans:
- Ruby LSP plugin for Inertia Rails
- Modals support

Stay tuned!
